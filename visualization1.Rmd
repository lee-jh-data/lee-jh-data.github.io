### 2. Summary

+ The dashboard has been developed for an e-commerce client to track advertising data and in-app activities (app installation, adding to cart, purchases) in real-time.
+ The dashboard is comprised of four main sections: Overview, Summary, Report, and Creative.
+ The Overview section is designed to monitor Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) collected from all advertising channels in real-time. It allows for an at-a-glance comparison of KPI trends, as well as advertising expenditure and performance across various media.
+ The Summary section is created to summarize and review key metrics from all media on a time-based scale.
+ The Report section is developed for a more detailed examination of performance, enabling the review of key metrics on a daily, weekly, and by-week basis.
+ The Creative section is designed to analyze the performance of each advertising creative. Integrated with each advertising platformâ€™s API, it allows users to click on an ad name within the dashboard and view the ad image directly.
